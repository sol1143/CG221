        <p>Hello! My name is Mollie.
          I am a pretty laid back person who enjoys learning and diving deep, especially about
          things that interest me. I have several different interests in different
          fields that really move me.</p>
          <br>
          Here are some that I'd like to share with you:
            <ul>
              <li>Art and Design (fine arts, illustration, animation, graphics, jewelry making and fashion)</li>
              <li>Science (astronomy, metaphysics, earth and marine life)</li>
              <li>Cooking/Preparing Food (raw foods, juicing, all kinds of cultural dishes, especially Mediterranean and Korean, and baking)
              <li>Dance and Theatre (ballet, contemporary dance, singing and expression)
              <li>Natural Medicine (herbal medicine, raw foods, mind/body relationships)
              <li>Spirituality (connecting to higher consciousness and developing a personal understanding)
              <li>Reading (philosophy, inspiring stories, educational texts and novels)
            </ul>
          <br>
        <p>These are some topics that I've come to devlop a liking and passion for during these last 5 years.
          Overall, I find it exciting to obtain knowledge and use it along with my creative energy to create work
          that I can share with others (large or small scale). I'm not sure what my purpose will be when I finish school,
          however I am following this path at the moment and believe everything will perfectly fall into place. In addition
          attempting to enjoy the ride, after all its the journey not the destination!</p>
          <br>
        <p>Thank You!</p>
          <br>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Mollie</p>
