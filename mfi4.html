        <p>This website tracks the different on-going flights all around the world. It's quite amazing how many on-going flights 
        there really are every day/every minute. You don't realize how many flights there actually are flying above us. With this 
        site, now you do!

        <p>This website is very uniquely designed. It isn't a typically structured
        page and seems as if it was designed by a brush. This unique element shows me 
        the development of web design. Most sites seem as if they are grid-like and highly
        structured, although this one shows me the more artistic side of web-design.
