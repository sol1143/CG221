        <p>This website is extremely useful for creating
          patterns for web sites/interfaces. They advertise
          themselves as "PATTERN LAB: helps you and your team
          build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces
          using atomic design principles." I really enjoy this
          site because it has a modern looking smooth user experience
          which is where web-design is headed these days. It helps
          me think/design an easy to use interface for all kinds
          of users. It helps me develop my design and thinking process.

        <p>This website is a useful tool that shows
          web designers the different grid options for
          web layouts. It presents a 1-16 grid system
          and is useful in seeing the different ratios
          and use of the grid system. It's a useful visual.
